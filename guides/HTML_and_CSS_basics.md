## Introduction

### Qualities of good HTML/CSS

What are some qualities of good HTML and CSS?

- Easy to use / intuitive
- Look nice
- Consistent
- Clean Code
- Accessible
- Responsive
- Browser Compatible

### The Front End Team

What's the difference between designers and developers?

Designer: making wire-frames / mock ups

Developer: writing the CSS code itself


### The CSS Ecosystem

- CSS Frameworks
  - CSS content that is made for you ahead of time, so that you can apply styles that you don't have to write yourself.
  - Examples:
    - Bootstrap
    - Semantic
- CSS Preprocessors / Tooling
  - Tools that make it easier to write CSS styles for yourself.
  - Examples:
    - Sass
    - Styled Components (react)

## Key Concepts

### Some vocabulary

- *HTML* is a markup language, which provides *tags* that allow us to display various kinds of media in a browser.

- *CSS* is a styling language, which provides the means to adjust the appearances of HTML tags.

- To change the appearance of an HTML tag, we make a *declaration*. The declaration targets some *property* of a tag and sets its *value*. 


### The Key to Understanding How CSS Works

HTML tags form a tree and CSS is built to exploit this tree structure.

- Some properties are inherited. By default, children will have the same value as their parent.
- The positioning of an element can depend on its own styles and the styles of its ancestors.
- CSS selectors can be written to explicitly care about the positions of tags in the tree.
- Problem solving in CSS often requires finding the right HTML structure.


### Ways to make declarations

1. Inline: a declaration attaches directly to a specific tag.
2. Style sheet: a declaration attaches to all tags of a certain type, defined using a *selector* (tag, class, id). 
    - Internal: written in the HTML header.
    - External: written in another file, which is linked to the header.

Examples: 

```html

    <!-- Inline -->
    <div style="color:red">Content</div>    

    <!-- Style Sheet -->

    <head>
        <style>
            /* Options: */
            #red-id {
                color: red
            }
            .red-class {
                color: red
            }
            div {
                color: red
            }
        </style> 
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="red-class" id="red-id"> Content</div>
    </body>
```

We can also combine selectors with each other various ways. Two of the most common:

1. `.class1 .class2` -- applies a style to anything with class2 that's a descendant of class1.
2. `.class1 > .class2` -- applies a styled to anything with class2 that's a direct child of something with class1.

Another helpful tip: you can use `*` to select everything.

### Specificity

When two declarations would style the attribute of a tag with two different values, what wins? Some rules:

1. Inline styling overrides stylesheets.
2. When using selectors, ID > Class > tag.
3. Selectors that reference HTML structure add specificity.
4. Later code overrides earlier code.


## CSS Basics Demo

### The Box Model

- Box Model: content, padding, border, margin.
- Content Size can be determined bottom-up or top-down. Both approaches have their uses.
- Units that can be useful: `px`, `rem`, `%`, `vw`/`vh`
- Make your life easier with `*{ box-sizing: border-box }`
- Spice things up with `border-radius`, `outline`, and `box-shadow`.

### Adding Colors and Fonts

- Color: `color`, `background`, `border`, `box-shadow`
- Font: `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-style`, `font-weight`, `text-decoration`, `text-align`, `letter-spacing`, `line-height`
- Use external tools to generate CSS values (Coolors, CSS Gradient, Google Fonts)
- Store colors and fonts in variables

### Making your HTML interactive (without JS)

- Use pseudo classes like `:hover`, `:active`, and `:focus` to respond to user interaction.
- Perform various transformations on elements using the `transform` attribute.
- Animate between two states using the `transition` attribute.
